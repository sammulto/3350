		<h2>Matthias Penner</h2>
		<p>Throughout the development of this application, I have gained an insight on how complex systems such as relational databases are integrated into a project with many moving parts on a new operating system. I also learned how to use git effectively in a way that makes adding new features easy and accidentally deleting features more difficult. Finally, I learned how important it is to set reasonable expectations as to not over commit or lose sleep over uncompleted features. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="8u 12u$(small)">
		<h2>Sammul To</h2>
		<p>Throughout the project, I have developed the following skills: write Android application UI activities and layout, test application UI elements by using Espresso, and manage application development flow and release by Git. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="8u 12u$(medium)">
		<h2>Rui Zhang</h2>
		<p>Throughout the project, I learned how to design a Android application UI with background logic to manipulate it. I also learned how to write unit test for the logic code in different ways such as Mocks and Stubs.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="8u 12u$(medium)">
		<h2>Zhijie Zheng</h2>
		<p>Throughout this project, I have learned how to use Android Studio and how to write Android application UI activities and layout. I also learned some design patterns like three-tier architecture, which gives us a clear view of how to design an Android application. And by learning how to work with the group, I have a deeper understanding of nowadays software design process. In the end, l have learned a more efficient way to manage our project by using Git. </p>
	</div>
    <div class="8u 12u$(medium)">
		<h2>Muhammad Bilal Sheikh</h2>
		<p>Throughout the course of this project, I learned how version control works and how we can safely work in groups and make many changes to a project simultaneously. I also learned how UI layers, business layer etc. come into play and how important it is to work in this model, and have these layers communicate with each other. Another is how different types of tests are implemented on our project to ensure a stable code is released. </p>
	</div>
    <div class="8u 12u$(medium)">
		<h2>Al Fahiyan Siyam</h2>
		<p>Throughout the development of this application, I have learned why n-tier development is important and how to maximize the potential of the development process. I had the opportunity to learn and work on UI and Business Layer in the android application development environment. Besides, I did practice the agile development process, by which I got the sense of how industrial-level software development gets done. Moreover, I have also learned about two new testing systems namely, Integration and System. That gave an idea of, why the testing for the development process is so important and how it helps to release well-conditioned software in the market. </p>
